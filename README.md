5. From the center of the image, in all directions, increase the RGB values of the pixels in a manner that, each pixel from the center, the percentage drops by 1%. i.e. the center pixel's RGB will increase by 50%, and the next pixels in x and y directions will be 49%. This goes on and on until the increase becomes 0 %.
